            <blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <sup><b>1</b></sup> Before I get started with my story, I would like to introduce myself, cuzâ€™ why not right? Iâ€™m <strong>Trisha Nicole T. Galacinao</strong>, 19 years old and an only child.
                <sup><b>2</b></sup> Born in the province of Isabela, wherein my childhood was filled with adventure and a profound sense of curiosity.
                <sup><b>3</b></sup> Growing up in a vibrant neighborhood where the air was always fresh and the skies were often painted with vibrant sunsets.
                <sup><b>4</b></sup> I was surrounded by a diverse group of children, and we spent countless of hours exploring the world around us not minding everything.
                <sup><b>5</b></sup> Just us filled with the sounds of laughter and enjoyment, a pure bliss to be exact.
                <sup><b>6</b></sup> My mother, also a teacher taught me how to read and write.
                <sup><b>7</b></sup> She was strict with me but I understand that, because that is how she shows that she truly wants me to learn and explore new things. 
                <sup><b>8</b></sup>  Within my childhood years, I was once a troublemaker, always on the go and always returning home with a wound left in my body.
                <sup><b>9</b></sup> Always curious, always questioning things, and I often wandered around the neighborhood, searching and looking all the places, I and we would explore.
                <sup><b>10</b></sup> Iâ€™ve learned how to ride a bicycle, thanks to my friends, play dress ups, cooking and many more that a child or children do when they are young.
                <sup><b>11</b></sup> Upon entering a school, there are so many people chatting and playing and it was a place of wonder for me, where I discovered my love for reading and storytelling.
                <sup><b>12</b></sup> Often losing myself in the pages of books that transported me to different realms.
                <sup><b>13</b></sup> Transporting to another world, expecting those things are real which fueled my imagination and desire to gain more new knowledge and readings about those.
                <sup><b>14</b></sup> School was fun, I learned something, shared secrets with them, waking up being late in the class and participating in the activities.
                <sup><b>15</b></sup> What I will never really forget is that I participated star scout to girl scout even though I always end up being sick.
                <sup><b>16</b></sup> I donâ€™t know why but I enjoyed participating.
                <sup><b>17</b></sup> Cooperating with other girls that I donâ€™t even know, I just casually talks to them and we became friends afterwards.
                <sup><b>18</b></sup> Star and Girl Scout was fun, the teachers also taught us how to tie a knot, form a bond with others, cooking, sewing and go to other places like other schools.
                <sup><b>19</b></sup> Family vacations were another highlight of my childhood, as we traveled to various cities, where I developed a profound appreciation for nature and for the environment.
                <sup><b>20</b></sup> These experiences shaped my character, teaching me the importance of exploration and the beauty of the world.

                <sup><b>1</b></sup> Progressing into adolescence introduced a countless of challenges and self-discovery that marked my teenage years.
                <sup><b>2</b></sup> These years were a true rollercoaster, with my life changing in unexpected ways.
                <sup><b>3</b></sup> I was often lost in the shadows of my aspirations, unable to voice the weight of my emotions.
                <sup><b>4</b></sup> Despite this chaotic environment, I found solace in friendships where I met them and thankful to have them in my life.
                <sup><b>5</b></sup> Through ups and downs, they are here to support me to the end and providing laughter and understanding I needed.
                <sup><b>6</b></sup> High school was not solely about academics, it also provided a space for growth and self-exploration.
                <sup><b>7</b></sup> Though often I fought feelings of hopelessness and confusion, the challenges of adolescence taught me resilience and empathy, a journey that shaped my character.
                <sup><b>8</b></sup> And of course, the travelling experience again.
                <sup><b>9</b></sup> My family and I never get tired when it comes to travelling. 
                <sup><b>10</b></sup> Within my childhood experiences up to my teenage years, we go on an adventure together.
                <sup><b>11</b></sup> My family always has a special place in my heart and I love them even though Iâ€™m too shy to say that in front of them.
                <sup><b>12</b></sup> Also, in my teenage years where the COVID 19 starts, everyone panics, I never forgot that because I had my birthday before the pandemic strikes.
                <sup><b>13</b></sup> It is not easy to adapt to new things, like Online classes, staying at home, no contact to other person. 
                <sup><b>14</b></sup> But I also discover Anime, despite the no contact with others, I found anime, my peace and comfort against the world.
                <sup><b>15</b></sup> Anime made a huge impact on me, it makes me happy, cry and all sorts of emotions I donâ€™t know I have.
                <sup><b>16</b></sup> And when the Philippines starts to rise up again, thatâ€™s when my Senior year comes. 
                <sup><b>17</b></sup> I had a great time there, the friendship I didnâ€™t expect to form and bond despite our different attitudes.
                <sup><b>18</b></sup> And I also didnâ€™t expect that I met him, that was so unexpected but he made me realize things I didnâ€™t know and he made me feel love again.
                <sup><b>19</b></sup> Iâ€™m also thankful for parents for granting my wish to have a Debut in my 18th birthday.
                <sup><b>20</b></sup> It was hectic and fun but it definitely engraves it in my heart and mind.
