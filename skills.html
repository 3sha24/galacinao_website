            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <sup><b>1</b></sup> Skills are the cornerstone of personal development, representing the learned capacities to perform actions proficiently. 
                <sup><b>2</b></sup> Acquiring and refining skills is not merely an option but a necessity in today‚Äôs dynamic world.
                <sup><b>3</b></sup> By investing in skill development, we the individuals empower ourselves to navigate new challenges, seize more opportunities and make meaningful contributions to society.
                <sup><b>4</b></sup> Like how I manage to adapt to any situation. Just like what I‚Äôve mentioned in my Biography.
                <sup><b>5</b></sup> That I choose to study here in Manila, leaving them, my family, my boyfriend and my friends.
                <sup><b>6</b></sup> It is so hard to be separated from them because I know that I can‚Äôt handle it physically and emotionally. 
                <sup><b>7</b></sup> Two weeks after school started, I felt a lump in my throat and I felt homesick. Like I‚Äôve been so lonely in my life. But the thought comes into my mind that I need to be brave and I know I can do this.
                <sup><b>8</b></sup> That‚Äôs when I started adapting to the surroundings.
                <sup><b>9</b></sup> I need to survive here in Manila to know what I will do and change what I need to.
                <sup><b>10</b></sup> Adapting is one thing I have in my skills.
                <sup><b>11</b></sup> At first, I was so shocked about the surroundings but eventually I have adjusted now.
                <sup><b>12</b></sup> And of course, the need to communicate to other people for familiarity.
                <sup><b>13</b></sup> One thing I also have is having a time management which I learned this from my father.
                <sup><b>14</b></sup> Every time we have an outing; he always makes sure to make it on time.
                <sup><b>15</b></sup> My Father is not a ‚ÄúFilipino type‚Äù of a man that‚Äôs why I learned to be like that.
                <sup><b>16</b></sup> By having a time management, all my works are on schedule at the right time.
                <sup><b>17</b></sup> I divide my time on learning new things, watching my favorite seasons or shows and my time on a tour.
                <sup><b>18</b></sup> I might say that I don‚Äôt have a lot of skills but maybe I do have another but I forgot what it is.
                <sup><b>19</b></sup> But along the way, I make sure that I know what I‚Äôm doing and making things right.
                <sup><b>20</b></sup> And that is a little too short for my Skills.

            <h3><u><i>‚ãÜÀö‡øî MY HOBBIES ùúóùúöÀö‚ãÜ</u></i></h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <sup><b>1</b></sup> I do have a lot of hobbies and hobbies can reduce stress, improve mental well-being, and enhance cognitive function.
                <sup><b>2</b></sup> Hobbies can also foster a sense of accomplishment, boost self-esteem, and provide opportunities for social interaction and community involvement.
                <sup><b>3</b></sup> It can also be a source of joy and fulfillment like one of my hobbies: Reading.
                <sup><b>4</b></sup> I do love reading, my mother taught me how to read and write.
                <sup><b>5</b></sup> She gave me mini books where there are a lot of stories with pictures to be read off.
                <sup><b>6</b></sup>  Every time I read a book, my mind wanders and imagine what I‚Äôm reading and that will make a fantasy like in my head and it is so cool.
                <sup><b>7</b></sup> Reading can be also a form of exercise especially on the brain where we learn new things or deeper meaning of those things.
                <sup><b>8</b></sup> And I could also say that writing is one of my hobbies.
                <sup><b>9</b></sup> When we don‚Äôt have anything to do at school, I write to past time.
                <sup><b>10</b></sup> I construct words, sentences and sometimes paragraphs to ease the boredom.
                <sup><b>11</b></sup> I also wrote a story before and it is all about me and a fantasy story one.
                <sup><b>12</b></sup> Dancing and exercising are also one of my hobbies, dancing and exercising can make me relax.
                <sup><b>13</b></sup> And it makes my body stretch all the way and the way I move is so flexible.
                <sup><b>14</b></sup> I sometimes combine dancing and exercising like Zumba, to ease the feeling and get the body heat up.
                <sup><b>15</b></sup> By doing those, it helps my mind and body to be relaxed and concentrate on the things I‚Äôm doing right now.
                <sup><b>16</b></sup> Oh, and also, I love playing badminton, my Tita taught me how to play that.
                <sup><b>17</b></sup> When I was a kid, I saw a badminton on the store and so curious what‚Äôs that so I talk to my parents that I want to know and learn that.
                <sup><b>18</b></sup> So, we purchase that and my Tita helps me and taught me what are the proper ways to play Badminton.
                <sup><b>19</b></sup> Though she is not a pro in playing badminton, she taught me decently and I play with my neighbors.
                <sup><b>20</b></sup> We also play basketball, soccer and volleyball before.
                <sup><b>21</b></sup> Watching, it also makes me relax in a way my mind is at ease.
                <sup><b>22</b></sup> Last but not the least, my favorite hobby is traveling.
                <sup><b>23</b></sup> Traveling does this to my body, I don‚Äôt know the feeling but it makes me so chill and relax.
                <sup><b>24</b></sup> Like legit, seeing the beauty of the nature upon us.
                <sup><b>25</b></sup> The Tourist spots we could sight and capture through our phones.
                <sup><b>26</b></sup> Nothing beats when travelling and especially when I‚Äôm with my family.
                <sup><b>27</b></sup> Like what I‚Äôve mention on my biography, that‚Äôs the fun I get when travelling with them and spending time with them and with my boyfriend.

            <h3><u><i>‚ãÜÀö‡øî MY INTEREST ùúóùúöÀö‚ãÜ</u></i></h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <sup><b>1</b></sup> My interest is somewhat similar to my hobbies.  
                <sup><b>2</b></sup> Like dancing, I was participating and become one of the leaders in Folk dance.
                <sup><b>3</b></sup> Folk dance is a tradition or custom of a particular people wherein a type of a dance usually is an expression of a historical or contemporary culture.
                <sup><b>4</b></sup> The first time I dance Folk dance; I taught it was hard for me to understand the steps but later on I am enjoying it with a lot of people.
                <sup><b>5</b></sup> And because of Folk dance, I also gain friends there which I can relate to and we are united with the Folk dance.
                <sup><b>6</b></sup> It makes us unite as one and knowing and acknowledging each other like we‚Äôve known each other for a year.
                <sup><b>7</b></sup> There are some cases that we argue but at the end of the day we discuss those things and make up.
                <sup><b>8</b></sup> I also volunteer before, even though the part of volunteering is hard I make the most of it by being positive and giving them what they need.
                <sup><b>9</b></sup> Because seeing the children giving them foods and shirts, it makes my heart warm.
                <sup><b>10</b></sup> Just by those smiles, it makes me cry and soft for them.
                <sup><b>11</b></sup> I also do community service before, with my friends for scholarship.
                <sup><b>12</b></sup> So, we list up our names and every time our Leader announce that we have to clean the Barangay, we gather our cleaning tools and get on with it.
                <sup><b>13</b></sup> By participating, we can lessen the burden of other people by cleaning in front of their houses.
                <sup><b>14</b></sup> Collecting garbage, separating them on biodegradable and non- biodegradable and plastics for reuse, reduce and recycle purposes.
                <sup><b>15</b></sup> I am learning Nihongo (Japanese Language) as a past time.
                <sup><b>16</b></sup> Because I love the shows and seasons of animation in Japan and also their voices and languages are kinda unique.
                <sup><b>17</b></sup> And I will not forget to include again this one: Traveling.
                <sup><b>18</b></sup> One of my biggest dreams is to go to Japan with my parents and my boyfriend.
                <sup><b>19</b></sup> Because Japan is so ahead of us, the technology is way too fast and the Tourist spots are so amazing.
                <sup><b>20</b></sup> The anime merchandise, the cosplayers, the cats, vending machines, the food all of it.
                <sup><b>21</b></sup> I would love to go there with my family and my boyfriend when the right time comes.
            </p>
